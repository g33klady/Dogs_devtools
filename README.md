# Super Sleuth Testers: Unlocking the Power of Browser Developer Tools

*Abstract*: There’s a tool to aid our testing that we all have access to all the time. It’s hidden in plain sight, you just have to know the secret code to get to it. This secret tool? The browser’s developer tools, of course! Learn how the developer tools in your browser can give you insight into what your application is really doing, access to artifacts vital to testing (like cookies and cache), and learn to speak to your application directly, like never before. Unlock a whole host of information about your application, and release your inner super sleuth tester!
